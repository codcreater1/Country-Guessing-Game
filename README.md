I always enjoyed playing flag guessing games online, and one day I thought — why not build my own version from scratch? That’s how this Country Guessing Game project was born.

It’s a console-based game developed in C++. The player is asked to guess the name of a country based on a random hint related to its flag (like “Red background with white crescent” for Turkey). If the answer is correct, the score increases. If it’s wrong, the player loses a point and gets a new random hint from that country’s list. After 3 wrong answers, the game ends.

One of the cool parts is that the player can choose a continent before starting — Europe, Asia, America, or even a Mix mode with all regions combined. I added over 100 countries, categorized by continent, each with multiple clues.

The logic is built using struct, vector, random, and other fundamental C++ tools. This project helped me practice many concepts like string handling, user input, loops, conditionals, and using STL features effectively.

If you're into flags or just want a quick mental challenge, this little game can be quite fun. And for me, it was a great way to turn a hobby into code.
